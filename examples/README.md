To start the game press the Y button, or the one on the top on the game controller. Once the game has started, a small colored dot appears that represents the player. To change the color of your player simply press the X button, or the one on the left, until you find the color you most like. The objective of the game is to avoid the obstacles as they fall from the sky. Once you have hit the start button, the game has begun and the objects will begin to fall. Using buttons A and B, or the right and left buttons, you can move your player left and right to avoid hitting the falling obstacles. If you fail to avoid one of the obstacles, the game is over and you lose. Good luck!
